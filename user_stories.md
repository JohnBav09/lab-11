As a developer I want to create a site that generates pictures, and tracks the amount of time that something is clicked. I also want to be able to display how many clicks were made on specific items. I also want to make the site stop clicking after the 25th click. Later in this we are going to have it track the total impressions of all consumers so that we can determine a click-through-rate, so that the Busmall site knows based off their data what products would work on the market based off of consumer needs.
